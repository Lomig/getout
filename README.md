# GetOut

## Context

Project we presented as our end-of-studies project, GetOut is a **Progressive Web App** (mobile only then) that connects to your spotify account to retrieve your favourite musical genres, and then let you find bars that would broadcast the same kind of music.

## Scope

We didn't deal with how bars could seed their own musical genres or their playlist. Apparently, at least in Paris, only Jazz Clubs are willing to create or share this kind of data.

As for the end-of-studies presentation, we manually seeded the app with more than 400 real bars (name, address, photos) but random musical genres, and fake playlist data.

The part that would tell you which artists you like can be seen on stage nearby has not been developped because of the short timeframe we had for the app.

## Technological Stack

- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org)
- [Stimulus JS](https://stimulusjs.org), a very cool JS microframework that plays nicely with Rails
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com) for deployment
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) for image storage
